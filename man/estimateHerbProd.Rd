\usage{
estimateHerbProd(
  inputDataList,
  inputBout = NA,
  inputMass = NA,
  plotSubset = "tower"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputDataList}{An R list object produced by the neonUtilities::loadByProduct() function for the NEON Herbaceous Clip Harvest data product. \link{list}}

\item{inputBout}{The 'hbp_perbout' table for the site x month combination(s) of interest
(defaults to NA). If table input is provided, the 'inputDataList' argument must be missing. \link{data.frame}}

\item{inputMass}{The 'hbp_massdata' table for the site x month combination(s) of interest
(defaults to NA). If table input is provided, the 'inputDataList' argument must be missing. \link{data.frame}}

\item{plotSubset}{The options are "all" (all Tower and Distributed plots), the default of "tower" (all plots in the Tower airshed but no Distributed plots), and "distributed" (all Distributed plots, which are sampled on a 5-year interval and are spatially representative of the NLCD classes at a site). \link{character}}
}
\value{
A list that includes productivity summary data frames. Output tables include:
\itemize{
\item herb_ANPP_site - Summarizes herbaceous ANPP for each site x year combination ("Mg/ha/yr" and "g/m2/yr").
\item herb_ANPP_plot - Summarizes herbaceous ANPP for the sum of all herbaceous plants for each plot x year combination ("Mg/ha/yr" and "g/m2/yr"). Plot-level summaries are not returned for grazed Tower plots, for the reason outlined in details.
\item herb_ANPP_plot_herbgroup - Summarizes herbaceous ANPP by herbGroup ("Cool Season Graminoids", "N-fixing Plants", etc.) for each plot x year combination ("Mg/ha/yr" and "g/m2/yr"). Plot-level summaries are not returned for grazed Tower plots.

\description{
Estimate above-ground herbaceous productivity using NEON Herbaceous Clip Harvest data tables (DP1.10023.001).
}
\details{
Input data should be a list of herbaceous biomass (DP1.10023.001) data frames downloaded via the neonUtilities::loadByProduct() function. The companion scaleHerbMass() function is called internally, and outputs from this function are used to estimate herbaceous productivity.

Where herbaceous plants are not subject to grazing management and exclosures are not in use, the estimate of herbaceous ANPP is simply the standing biomass of the last bout of the season.

Where grazing management occurs in Tower plots and exclosures have been established, consumption is calculated for each Tower plot gsampling event as average biomass within exclosures minus average biomass outside of exclosures. Consumption at each sampling bout is summed and then added to the standing biomass of the last bout of the season for an estimate of herbaceous ANPP.

Note that the Science Design only supports calculating consumption at the site level. The clip harvests within exclosures are not close enough to ambient clip harvests to support plot-level consumption estimates.
