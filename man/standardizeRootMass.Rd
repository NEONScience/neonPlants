\title{Standardize root dry mass data to current size and root status categories}
\usage{
standardizeRootMass(inputDataList, inputMass = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputDataList}{A list object comprised of Plant Below Ground Biomass tables (DP1.10067.001)
downloaded using the neonUtilities::loadByProduct function (defaults to required). If list input is
provided, the table input argument must be NA; similarly, if list input is missing, the 'inputMass'
table input must be provided. \link{list}}

\item{inputMass}{The 'bbc_rootmass' table for the site x month combination(s) of interest
(defaults to NA). If table input is provided, the 'inputDataList' argument must be missing.
\link{data.frame}}
}
\value{
A table containing root mass data for three sizeCategories (< 1mm, 1-2mm, and 2-10mm)
and dryMass values pooled across previously utilized "live/dead" rootStatus categories. The
output no longer contains the 'rootStatus' field, and any QA dryMass samples are averaged.
}
\description{
NEON root mass data collected prior to 2019 were sorted to four sizeCategories and
were parsed into "live" and "dead" rootStatus categories. Beginning in 2019 the two smallest
sizeCategories (< 0.5mm and 0.5-1mm) were combined into a single < 1mm sizeCategory and roots
were no longer sorted to "live/dead". This function combines the older smallest two sizeCategories
into the current < 1mm category and pools together roots previously categorized as "live" and
"dead".

Data inputs are NEON Plant Belowground Biomass data (DP1.10067.001) retrieved using the
neonUtilities::loadByProduct function (preferred), data downloaded from the NEON Data Portal,
or input data tables with an equivalent structure and representing the same site x month combinations.
}
\details{
Input data may be provided either as a list generated from the neonUtilities::laodByProduct()
function or as individual tables. However, if both list and table inputs are provided at the same time
the function will error out.

NEON weighs a minimum of 5\% of samples a second time so that data users can estimate
the uncertainty associated with different technicians weighing dried roots; QA samples of this
nature are identified via qaDryMass == "Y". The function calculates the mean when QA masses
exist and any 'remarks' are concatenated. Samples with Sampling Impractical values other than "OK"
are removed prior to summarizing the input data.

\dontrun{
#   Obtain NEON Plant Belowground Biomass data
bbc <- neonUtilities::loadByProduct(
dpID = "DP1.10067.001",
site = "all",
startdate = "2022-07",
enddate = "2022-08",

#   Standardize downloaded root data to current sizeCategories and rootStatus
